**Script of Scripts (SoS)** is a lightweight workflow system that helps you oraganize your commands and scripts in different languages into readable workflows that can be easily understood and modified by others. It is an easy-to-use alternative to specialized workflow systems such as [CWL](http://common-workflow-language.github.io/draft-3/) which makes it an ideal tool for the creation and maintainance of workflows that need to be frequently updated and shared with others.
